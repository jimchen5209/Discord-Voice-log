## Voice Activity Sound

 For the voice activity sound, put the following file into `asset/` folder:
```
<User ID>_join.wav --Connected to the channel
<User ID>_left.wav --Left the channel
<User ID>_switched_out.wav --Switched out from the channel
<User ID>_switched_in.wav --Switched into the channel
```
or place `<User ID>.json` into `asset/` folder with:
```json
{
  "lang": "<language from google translate>",
  "join": "<Text when connected to the channel>",
  "left": "<Text when left the channel>",
  "switched_out": "<Text when switched out from the channel>",
  "switched_in": "<Text when switched into to the channel>"
}
```
If you want to use the new google cloud text to speech, be sure to have apiKey in the config, and json content is:
```json
{
  "use_wave_tts":true,
  "lang": "<language from google cloud>",
  "voice": "<voice from google cloud>",
  "join": "<Text when connected to the channel>",
  "left": "<Text when left the channel>",
  "switched_out": "<Text when switched out from the channel>",
  "switched_in": "<Text when switched into to the channel>"
}
```
`lang` and `voice` available from https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices

```json
{
  "lang": "en_US",
  "join": "Jim joined the channel",
  "left": "Jim left the channel",
  "switched_out": "Jim switched out from the channel",
